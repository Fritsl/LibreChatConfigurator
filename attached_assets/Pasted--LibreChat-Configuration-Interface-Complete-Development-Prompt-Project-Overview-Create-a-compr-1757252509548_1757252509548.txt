# LibreChat Configuration Interface - Complete Development Prompt ## Project Overview
Create a comprehensive web-based configuration interface for LibreChat v0.8.0-rc3 that allows users to configure all 73 settings through a modern, professional UI and generate complete installation packages.

## Core Requirements ### 1. **Complete Configuration Coverage**
Implement ALL 73 configuration options from the attached list (see attached list)
Each setting must be properly categorized, documented, and have appropriate input controls
Support for environment variables (.env) and librechat.yaml configurations
Load default settings from the original attached installation files
### 2. **Modern Professional UI Design**
Use Tailwind CSS for all styling - create a modern, enterprise-grade interface
Implement a clean, gradient-based design with proper spacing and typography
Use card-based layouts with shadows, rounded corners, and proper visual hierarchy
Color-coded tabs with icons for easy navigation
Responsive design that works on desktop, tablet, and mobile
Professional color scheme with gradients and modern aesthetics
### 3. **Technical Architecture**
Frontend: React.js with Vite build system
Backend: Flask API with comprehensive endpoints
Styling: Tailwind CSS with custom components
UI Components: Use shadcn/ui or similar modern component library
State Management: React hooks for configuration state
File Generation: Backend generates complete installation packages
### 4. **Configuration Categories (17 Tabs)**
Organize all 73 settings into these categories:

Server - Host, port, proxy settings
Security - JWT secrets, encryption, CORS
Database - MongoDB, Redis configuration
UI/Visibility - Interface element visibility controls
Models/Specs - AI model specifications and limits
Endpoints - API endpoint configurations
Agents - AI agent definitions and capabilities
Files - File upload, storage, and processing limits
Rate Limits - User and IP-based rate limiting
Authentication - Social logins, domain restrictions
Memory - AI memory and personalization settings
Search - Web search, vector search configuration
MCP - Model Context Protocol servers
OCR - Document processing and OCR settings
Actions - OpenAPI tool domains and configurations
Temp Chats - Temporary chat retention settings
Generate - Package generation and download
### 5. **Default Settings Integration**
Parse and load all settings from the original attached installation files
Pre-populate the interface with existing MCP servers, agents, and configurations
Maintain compatibility with the original setup while allowing full customization
Support for multiple configuration profiles (future enhancement)
### 6. **Input Control Types**
Implement appropriate controls for each setting type:

Text inputs - For strings, URLs, paths
Number inputs - For integers, timeouts, limits
Toggle switches - For boolean values
Dropdowns/Select - For enumerated options
Textareas - For multi-line text, instructions, descriptions
Array inputs - For lists of values (domains, IPs, etc.)
Object builders - For complex nested configurations
File uploads - For certificates, keys, etc.
### 7. **Package Generation System**
Create a comprehensive "Generate" tab that:

Shows configuration summary and validation status
Displays pre-generation checklist with status indicators
Generates complete installation package containing:
.env file with all environment variables
librechat.yaml with complete YAML configuration
docker-compose.yml for container orchestration
install.sh automated installation script
README.md with setup instructions and documentation
Downloads as a ZIP file for easy deployment
### 8. **Advanced Features**
Real-time validation - Validate settings as user types
Configuration preview - Show generated config files before download
Import/Export - Load and save configuration profiles
Search functionality - Find specific settings quickly
Help tooltips - Context-sensitive help for each setting
Dependency management - Show when settings depend on others
Error handling - Clear error messages and recovery options
### 9. **Backend API Requirements**
Implement Flask endpoints for:

GET /api/settings/load - Load default settings from original files
POST /api/settings/validate - Validate configuration
POST /api/settings/generate - Generate installation package
GET /api/settings/preview - Preview generated files
POST /api/settings/save - Save configuration profile
GET /api/settings/profiles - List saved profiles
### 10. **Styling Guidelines**
Using Tailwind CSS, create:

Modern gradient backgrounds - Subtle gradients for visual appeal
Card-based layouts - White cards with shadows and rounded corners
Professional typography - Clear hierarchy with proper font weights
Color-coded elements - Each tab/category has its own color theme
Smooth transitions - Hover effects and smooth animations
Responsive grid layouts - Proper spacing on all screen sizes
Form styling - Large, clear inputs with focus states
Button styling - Gradient buttons with hover effects
Status indicators - Color-coded badges and icons for status
### 11. **Quality Requirements**
100% setting coverage - Every setting from the attached list must be implemented
Professional appearance - Enterprise-grade UI that looks polished
Full functionality - All features must work end-to-end
Error-free operation - Proper error handling and validation
Mobile responsive - Works perfectly on all device sizes
Fast performance - Optimized loading and interaction speeds
Clean code - Well-organized, commented, maintainable code
### 12. **Deliverables**
Provide:

Complete React frontend with all 17 tabs and 73 settings
Flask backend with all required API endpoints
Modern Tailwind CSS styling throughout the application
Package generation system that creates complete installation packages
Documentation explaining the architecture and usage
Deployment instructions for production use
## Reference Materials
Settings List: See attached list (contains all 73 configuration options with descriptions)
Original Installation: Original attached files (contains existing setup to use as defaults)
LibreChat Version: v0.8.0-rc3 compatibility required
Styling Framework: Tailwind CSS mandatory
## Success Criteria
The interface should be indistinguishable from a professional enterprise software configuration tool, with every LibreChat setting accessible through an intuitive, modern web interface that generates production-ready installation packages.

Create a system that allows users to easily configure their LibreChat installation with all advanced features like MCP servers, AI agents, rate limiting, authentication, and more through a beautiful, professional web interface.
