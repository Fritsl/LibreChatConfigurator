# How to Go Live: LibreChat Configuration Tool Public Release

## Project Vision
Transform the LibreChat Configuration Tool into a **community-driven, MIT-licensed open-source project** that serves as the definitive configuration management solution for LibreChat deployments. This tool generates complete setup files and deployment packages from comprehensive LibreChat configuration knowledge.

## Current Status Assessment

### ✅ What's Ready
- **Core Functionality**: Comprehensive configuration interface covering 280+ LibreChat settings
- **Export System**: Generates .env, librechat.yaml, docker-compose, and installation scripts
- **Modern Tech Stack**: React + TypeScript + Tailwind CSS + Express.js
- **Progressive Disclosure UX**: Smart interfaces for complex configurations (OAuth, Search, Caching)
- **1-Click Integrations**: MeiliSearch, Caching presets, and automated setups

### ⚠️ What Needs Work
- **Documentation**: No README, quickstart, or contribution guidelines
- **Deployment Simplification**: Current setup requires technical knowledge
- **Code Organization**: Some debugging code and hardcoded values remain
- **Testing Infrastructure**: No automated tests or CI/CD
- **Community Infrastructure**: No issue templates, PR guidelines, or roadmap
- **LibreChat Beta Compatibility**: Some settings may not work in current LibreChat beta
